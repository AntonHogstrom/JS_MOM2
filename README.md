## Moment 2

This assignment was an introduction to using NodeJs with Express.
I used Express-generator to generate a skeleton to use.

For the assigntment to be successful API calls for GET all, GET specific, DELETE would work.
On the client side, viewed by PUG GET all and DELETE should work.

These functions are implemented but not all CRUD.
